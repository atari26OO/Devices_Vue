# Devices_Vue

Notes:

-DevicesSocket single file component will receive data via socket and display it. However, the WebSocket is not connecting:( I put some sample JSON messages for demonstration.

-DevicesProps single file component will receive messages as JSON objects. App component calls DevicesProps component with sample JSON objects for demonstration.
